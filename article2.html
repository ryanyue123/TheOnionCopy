				<strong>IRVINE, CA --- </strong>
				"There's always room for more," says Joey Burger, heavyweight champion of the <a href="http://www.majorleagueeating.com/">Major League Eating Competition.</a> This is the same motto that the Middle Earth Housing Team lives by.
				The Middle Earth Housing Office has just announced plans to upgrade all dorm rooms to the new and improved quintuple style for the upcoming school year. The reason for this change is to accommodate for the high volume of incoming freshmen. As seen in the picture on the left, the new quintuple dorm room will feature a single bed frame with five bunks, maximizing the efficiency of space usage while creating a comfortable environment to sleep and study. Many students have voiced their opinions about this news design. Benjamin Hung, a first year at UC Irvine, stated "the proposed changes almost make me want to live in Arroyo Vista. As a freshman!" Other students have also had concerns about sturdiness, potential head injuries, and the difficulty of deciding who gets which bunk.
				In response to these concerns, the director of housing has stated that he "currently [has] a team of UC Berkeley engineers working out the physics behind this revolutionary idea," and he "hope[s] that these new dorm designs will inspire universities across the nation to create better learning environments for their students." Other universities with large undergraduate populations have already started making plans to adopt this cutting edge design. The director of construction is currently partnering with MSPaint Inc. to finalize the preliminary schematics of these new rooms.
