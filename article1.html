				<strong>IRVINE, CA --- </strong>
				Students are lining up for what some say is the biggest event of the entire school year, the annual Anteater football kickoff game. Each year, undefeated Anteaters look to keep their zero loss record and make the students of UC Irvine proud to shout "Zot! Zot! Zot!". This game marks the beginning of the regular season and attracts the attention of fans from all around Orange County. "The game is so hyped that people will often campout two or three nights before just to get good seats," said Charles Chu, senior at UC Irvine. An anonymous member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity also explained the culture that revolves around these football games. He mentioned that "All the fraternities throw massive tailgating parties in the Frat Houses on Frat Row." However, not all students share the same loyalty and love for college football. "I think the school should have spent the money on education rather than sports. We could've used the money spent building the stadium to buy new equipment for labs or maybe even build a new science library," shares junior Amy Cai, as she and a group of protesters demonstrated outside the entrance of the stadium. Despite the opposition, thousands of Anteaters, dressed in blue and gold, are lining up to participate in this 50-year-old tradition. This year, Anteaters will face off against last yearâ€™s winner of the Rose Bowl, Syracuse University, in what is predicted to be the closest matchup of the entire season. 
				<br><br>
				Kickoff will start tonight at 6 p.m. at the Ayala Football Stadium. You can also tune in online at
